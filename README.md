# Hello World Hello Girls 🌍👩‍💻

Welcome to **Hello World Hello Girls**! Our mission is to empower young girls around the world by exposing them to role models, innovative technology, and the tools to build their futures in tech.

## 🌟 About Us

Hello World Hello Girls was created to address the gender gap in computer science. Inspired by the fact that only 10% of my computer science class was made up of girls, we wanted to change that! Through workshops, sponsorships, and global outreach, we strive to help young girls dream big and see themselves in tech.

## 🎓 Our Programs

- **Workshops:** Sponsored by Amazon Web Services, our workshops provide hands-on experience in coding, design, and problem-solving.
- **Inspirational Speakers:** We invite women from diverse tech fields to share their journeys and inspire girls to pursue their dreams.
- **Global Outreach:** We connect with students from multiple countries, creating a supportive and diverse community.

## 📈 Impact

Since our founding, we’ve reached **hundreds of girls** across the globe, encouraging them to pursue careers in technology and STEM.
